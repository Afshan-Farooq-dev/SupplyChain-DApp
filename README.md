# Supply Chain Transparency and Audit Trail DApp

This project is a simple **decentralized application (DApp)** made to track products in a **supply chain**. It shows the product’s **current status, location, and full history**. The system uses **blockchain** on the **Ethereum Sepolia Testnet** to keep everything **secure and transparent**.

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Add a product (with name, description, location)
* 🔄 Update product status and location (e.g., Manufactured, Shipped, Delivered)
* 🔍 View product details by ID
* 📋 See a list of all added products
* 🛠️ Admin can allow or remove users from the system

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* **Solidity** – for writing smart contracts
* **Ethereum Sepolia Testnet** – blockchain network
* **MetaMask** – wallet connection
* **Web3.js** – connects frontend with blockchain
* **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – for the user interface
* **Remix IDE** – to write, test, and deploy smart contracts

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Admin deploys the contract on Sepolia Testnet.
2. Admin authorizes users to use the system.
3. Authorized users can add or update product details.
4. Anyone can view product information (status + history) using the product ID.
